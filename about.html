                <p>Hello my name is Dylan. I'm currently a senior at Tesla STEM highschool. 3d modeling has always been a passion and hobby for me since I was introduced five years ago. I've made countless 3d prints and game models and will continue to do so for the years to come. If you have any 3d modeling questions, email me at dylanyue322@gmail.com</p>
